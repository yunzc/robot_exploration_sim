# robot_exploration_sim

I created this package in conjunction with my work on pursuit evasion (the other parts of the project
are currently not released yet). This sim is used alongside ROS and provides visualization on where the
evader could be and how the pursuer is searching the environment. Ongoing, so updates should be frequent.
